# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to **security@cotrain.ai**.

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Type of issue** (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue**
- **The location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue**
- **Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue**
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact of the issue**, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Security Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.

2. **Initial Assessment**: We will perform an initial assessment of the reported vulnerability within 5 business days.

3. **Investigation**: We will investigate the vulnerability and determine its impact and severity.

4. **Fix Development**: We will develop and test a fix for the vulnerability.

5. **Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on the disclosure timeline.

6. **Release**: We will release the security patch and publish a security advisory.

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security

- Never commit secrets, API keys, or passwords to the repository
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Follow secure coding practices and OWASP guidelines
- Implement proper error handling without information disclosure
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Implement proper authentication and authorization checks

### Dependency Security

- Regularly update dependencies to latest secure versions
- Use `npm audit` or `pnpm audit` to check for vulnerabilities
- Pin dependency versions in production
- Review third-party packages before adding them
- Use tools like Snyk or Dependabot for automated vulnerability scanning

### Infrastructure Security

- Use strong, unique passwords and enable 2FA
- Regularly rotate API keys and access tokens
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Keep systems and software updated
- Use secure communication channels
- Implement proper logging and monitoring

## Security Tools and Scanning

### Automated Security Scanning

- **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing with CodeQL
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning with Dependabot
- **Container Scanning**: Docker image vulnerability scanning
- **Secret Scanning**: GitHub secret scanning for committed secrets
- **License Scanning**: Open source license compliance checking

### Manual Security Testing

- **Penetration Testing**: Regular third-party security assessments
- **Code Reviews**: Security-focused code review process
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Professional audit of blockchain components
- **Infrastructure Reviews**: Security assessment of deployment infrastructure

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Classification

- **Critical**: Immediate threat to user data or system integrity
- **High**: Significant security vulnerability with potential for exploitation
- **Medium**: Security issue with limited impact or difficult exploitation
- **Low**: Minor security concern or theoretical vulnerability

### Response Timeline

- **Critical**: Immediate response (within 1 hour)
- **High**: Response within 4 hours
- **Medium**: Response within 24 hours
- **Low**: Response within 72 hours

### Communication

During a security incident, we will:

1. Acknowledge the incident within the specified timeline
2. Provide regular updates on investigation progress
3. Coordinate disclosure with the reporter
4. Publish security advisories for confirmed vulnerabilities
5. Notify affected users if necessary

## Bug Bounty Program

We maintain a responsible disclosure program to reward security researchers who help us improve our security.

### Reward Structure
